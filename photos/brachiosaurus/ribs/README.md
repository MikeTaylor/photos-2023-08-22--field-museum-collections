# Variable pneumatic features in the ribs of _Brachiosaurus_


## Introduction

In his descriptive monograph, Riggs (1904) gives the ribs rather short shrift, describing them in a single paragraph (p239) of only 17 lines which doesn't even say how many there are. In the introduction he mentions "... a number of ribs, more or less complete" (p230).

### Anatomical terminology

In life, the position and orientation of sauropod ribs was complex, and is not fully understood. Broadly speaking, they move as though rotating about a hinge along the line from diapophysis to parapophysis (i.e. from capitulum to tuberculum on the rib itself), but as the extent and shape of articular cartilage on both the ribs and their vertebrae is unknown, it is not possible to make a precise assessment either of neutral position or range of motion.

Rather than attempt to discuss directions on ribs according to life position, then, we adopt the descriptive convention of a rib being oriented vertically. The proximal face of the rib that would in life have been oriented in some posteroventromedial direction is here consider to be posterior, so that the directions up and down the rib are proximal (towards the vertebra) and distal (towards the belly); and the directions across the shaft of the rib are medial and lateral.

## Description

### Rib A

One of them, which I designate [Rib A](rib-a), is illustrated by Riggs (1903:fig 6) and slightly more informatively by Riggs (1904:plate LXXV:figure 5). It consists of a complete proximal end, and some (not all) of the more distal portion, and it has a small pneumatic opening some way down the shaft. I interpret it as a right rib in with the posterior aspect upwards, based on the concavity of the visible face and the curvature of the shaft. The rib is well preserved except for signs of reconstruction in the too-neat lamination of the tuberculum. It measures 53 cm across the capitulum and tuberculum.

This rib's pneumatic opening is small and oval, and located about 60 cm down the shaft. It has been carefully prepared, and has finished bone inside. It measures 49 mm proximodistally and 25 mm mediolaterally. Its depth is 22 mm deep at both the medial edge and proximal end, and 18 mm at both the proximal edge and distal end. Feeling around inside the opening, it seems likely that it extended further distally into the rib, although the possible extension has understandably not been prepared out. This is in agreement with Riggs's (1903:304-305) description "The anterior surface of the shaft below the head perforated by a large foramen which leads to an internal cavity in the shaft".

(Taylor 2009:792 says that this opening is on the anterior face, probably following Riggs 1903:304 and Riggs 1904:239, but this is incorrect.)

### Rib B

The second rib of interest I designate [Rib B](rib-b). Riggs does not illustrate it, but it may be the rib to which he refers when he writes "In the mid-thoracic region [the ribs] measure fully nine feet (2.745m) in length" (Riggs 1903:304) and "one of the more slender ribs from the mid-thoracic region measures fully nine feet (2.745 m.) in length" (Riggs 1904:239). Like Rib A, it consists of a complete proximal end, and some (not all) of the more distal portion, well preserved. It measures 56 cm across the capitulum and tuberculum. I interpret it as a left rib with the posterior aspect upwards.

The pneumatic opening in this rib is not described by Riggs (1903, 1904), though it was mentioned briefly by Taylor (2009:792). It more closely resembles that documented by Janensch (1950:108) for _Giraffatitan brancai_ and those found in other sauropods, in that it invades the tuberculum rather than the shaft. Specifically, the lateral part of the tuberculum is anteroposteriorly deeper than the the medial part, projecting posteriorly from the surface of the rib, and the opening is in the medial face of this projection, extending laterally into the bone. The opening has been fully prepared out and is lined with finished bone. It is shaped like a teardrop flattened on one side, extending parallel to the rib shaft. It measures 120 mm proximodistally and has a maximum width of about 33 mm, near its distal end: an exact measurement is difficult to determine as the medial margin of the opening merges smoothly onto the posterior face of the rib rather than ending in a lip, as the lateral margin does. The depth of the opening is about 50 mm towards its proximal end and 33 mm at its distal end. It is possible that the opening extended further proximally into the tuberculum.

### Other ribs

Riggs's descriptions mention Rib A and possibly Rib B  as discussed above. [The overview photos](overview) from the collections show that there are three further ribs, for a total of five. Of these, one has only part of the proximal end, one only a section of the shaft, and one a partial proximal end and a broken-off more distal portion.

None of these ribs have visible pneumatic features. It is possible their hidden faces have such features, but there is no particular reason to expect that they do.


## Discussion

The pneumatic foramen in Rib B closely corresponds to the location of pneumatic features expected according to the schema of Wedel and Taylor (in review, a), which predicts that pneumatic features in costal elements would follow vascular foramina from the intercostal arteries. The smaller and more distal fossa in Rib A is more puzzling. XXX Discuss its likely origin.
