The is the right ilium lying on its medial side (so with the lateral side visible). One curious feature is a turbercle of bone towards the posterior end of the dorsal margin. I have tried to document this here, but shelves made it hard to get close. At any rate, these photos establish that it's real bone. But whether it's a real osteological feature, or some other chunk of bone that somehow became attached, I couldn't confidently say.
