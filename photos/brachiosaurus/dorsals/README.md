The _Brachiosaurus_ holotype contains the last seven dorsals, which Riggs sensibly numbered as presacrals 1-7 rather than guess at the total dorsal count. At the time I visited, presacrals 6 and 7 were on display in the public gallery -- rather sheepishly in a cabinet in the corner behind the _Apatosaurus_.

The other five presacrals are in collections, and shown here: 1, 2 and 3 in a three-space cart, and 4 and 5 in the last two positions of a four-space cart which also has spaces for the vertebrae on exhibit.

I noticed two new things on my visit:

1. In presacral 5, only presacral 5, the posterior opening of the neural canal is shifted way off to the right -- much more so than the photos I was able to get show. (The photos aren't great because presacral 4 was in the way, and there was absolutely no way of moving these vertebrae.)

2. In presacrals 1, 2 and 4, the pneumatic openings in the centra are strangely skewed, extending much deeper into the base of the centrum on the left side of the vertebra, and extending much higher up towards the neural arch on the right. (See [my lame sketch of the cross-sections in posterior view](PXL_20230822_182221859.jpg).) This is surprising because the skewing of the pneumatic features goes in the opposite direction from that of the cotyles. A similar but less pronounced condition is also found in presacrals 3 and 5, in which the pneumatic opening extends deeper on the left but there is no correspondingly higher extension on the right.
