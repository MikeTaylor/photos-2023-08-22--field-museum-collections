When the Field Museum sacriligiously got rid of their glorious mounted <i>Brachiosaurus</i> to make way to Sue the vulgar overstudied theropod, that mount was moved to Chicago's O'Hare Airport. I was delighted to find on my recent trip to Chicago that I would be flying out of Terminal 1, where it can be found on Concourse B.

My first site of it was at a distance, from the security queue, where I could see its tail poking over the barrier, and its back and neck on the other side (as seen in [the first photo here](PXL_20230822_205832917.jpg)).

Once I'd made it through security I bought a superb crispy chicken sandwich and a can of IPA from [Tortas Frontera](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2022/08/15/best-restaurant-ohare-tortas-frontera/), sat down by the mount, and consumed them as I gazed upon its glory, from the perspective shown in [the second photo](PXL_20230822_214550066.jpg).

I have more to say about the remaining photos in this set, but they will have to wait for another day.
