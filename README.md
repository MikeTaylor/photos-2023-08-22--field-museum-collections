Photographs taken on my visit to the Vertebrate Palaeontology collection at the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois, USA, on Tuesday 22 August 2023.

My thanks to Bill Simpson, collections manager, for arranging my visit at very short notice.

See the `README.md` files in some of the individual directories for more information.
